u4pak
=====

Unpack, pack, list, test and mount Unreal Engine 4 .pak archives.

Basic usage:

    u4pak.py list <archive>                 - list contens of .pak archive
    u4pak.py test <archive>                 - test archive integrity
    u4pak.py unpack <archive>               - extract .pak archive
    u4pak.py pack <archive> <files>         - create .pak archive
    u4pak.py mount <archive> <mount-point>  - mount archive as read-only file system

Only unencryped and uncompressed archives of version 1, 2, and 3 are supported.
Note that only version 2 and 3 are tested.

The `mount` command depends on the [llfuse](https://code.google.com/p/python-llfuse/)
Python package. If it's not available the rest is still working.

This script is compatible with Python 2.7 and 3 (tested with 2.7.5 and 3.3.2).

File Format
-----------

Only what is absolutely necesarry to read archives is reverse engineered.

Byte order is little endian and the character encoding of file names seems to be
ASCII (or ISO-8859-1/UTF-8 that coincidentally only uses ASCII compatiple
characters).

Offsets and sizes seem to be 64bit or at least unsigned 32bit integers. If
interpreted as 32bit integers all sizes (except the size of file names) and offsets
are followed by another 32bit integer of the value 0, which makes me guess these
are 64bit values. Also some values exceed the range of signed 32bit integers, so
they have to be at least unsigned 32bit integers. This information was reverse
engineered from the Elemental [Demo](https://wiki.unrealengine.com/Linux_Demos)
for Linux (which contains a 2.5 GB .pak file).

Basic layout:

 * Data Records
 * Index
  * Index Header
  * Index Records
 * Footer

In order to parse a file you need to read the footer first. The footer contains
an offset pointer to the start of the index records. The index records then
contain offset pointers to the data records.

### Record

    Offset  Size  Type         Description
         0     8  uint64_t     offset
         8     8  uint64_t     size (N)
        16     8  uint64_t     uncompressed size
        24     4  uint32_t     compression method:
                                  0x00 ... none
                                  0x01 ... zlib
                                  0x10 ... bias memory
                                  0x20 ... bias speed
    if version <= 1
        28     8  uint64_t     timestamp
    end
         ?    20  uint8_t[20]  data sha1 hash
    if version >= 3
     if compression method != 0x00
      ?+20     4  uint32_t     block count (M)
      ?+24  M*16  CB[M]        compression blocks
     end
         ?     1  uint8_t      is encrypted
       ?+1     4  uint32_t     compression block size
    end
    if version >= 4
         ?     1  uint32_t     unknown
    end

### Compression Block (CB)

Size: 16 bytes

    Offset  Size  Type         Description
         0     8  uint64_t     start offset:
                               Absolute offset of the start of the compression block.
         8     8  uint64_t     end offset:
                               Absolute offset of the end of the compression block.
                               This may not align completely with the start of the
                               next block.

### Data Record

    Offset  Size  Type            Description
         0     ?  Record          file metadata (offset field is 0, N = compressed_size)
         ?     N  uint8_t[N]      file data

### Index Record

    Offset  Size  Type            Description
         0     4  uint32_t        file name size (S)
         4     S  char[S]         file name
       4+S     ?  Record          file metadata

### Index

    Offset  Size  Type            Description
         0     4  uint32_t        mount point size (S)
         4     S  char[S]         mount point
       S+4     4  uint32_t        record count (N)
       S+8     ?  IndexRecord[N]  records

### Footer

Size: 44 bytes

    Offset  Size  Type         Description
         0     4  uint32_t     magic: 0x5A6F12E1
         4     4  uint32_t     version: 1, 2, or 3
         8     8  uint64_t     index offset
        16     8  uint64_t     index size
        24    20  uint8_t[20]  index sha1 hash
